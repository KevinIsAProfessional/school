Learning Outcomes:
  1) Understand how biologists construct phylogenies. How do we interpret them and what do they tell us about life on Earth?
  2) Have a sense of the history of life on Earth.  How long ago did life arise?  For how long has life existed as single-celled organisms?  When did multicellular life arise?
  3) Understand the role that endosymbiosis has played in the evolution of major groups of organisms. 
  4) Know a few key organisms in each of the main groups we will be talking about. 
  5) Have a sense of how we(try to)characterize biological diversity.
  6) Understand how biodiversity has changed through time. What were the major extinction crises?  What is happening during the Anthropocene?
  7) Have fun! We don’t need space travel to discover amazing forms of life –we share a planet with an astounding diversity of living creatures, most of which have not been “discovered.”Most organisms on Earth have not been described or given names!
