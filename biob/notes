Prosimians: monophyletic/ paraphyletic
Night monkeys: Polyphyletic
Simians: monophyletic


convergent evolution

monophyletic would involve "everyone in your family"
polyphyletic would involve people from different families, without similar ancestors
paraphyletic would involve some people from your family (ancestrally related) but not everybody.

why did the lorises and tarsiers evolve to have similar traits even though they didn't have similar ancestors? 
  It was likely advantageous to have that trait, so advantageous that it mutated twice along the evolutionary tree, and both times that trait outperformed the previous/ concurrent generations and remained dominant.
