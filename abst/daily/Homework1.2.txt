Definition 2.1:
  An integer is even if n=2k for some integer k.
  
Definition 2.2
  An integer is odd if n=2k+1 for some integer k.

Fact 2.3.1
  Every integer is either even or odd, but never both

Fact 2.3.2
  Sums and products of integers are integers









Problem 2.4: If n is an integer then the sum of n and n+1 is odd.
  Proof:
    Let n be an integer. By adding n+(n+1), we get 2n+1. By definition 2.2, we see that the sum of n and n+1 is odd for all n. []









Problem 2.5: If n is an even integer, then n^2 is an even integer.
  Proof:
    Let n be an even integer. Using definition 2.1, we can express n^2 as (2k)^2, which can then be expressed as 4k^2. 
    Let us define a new variable j, where 2k^2=j. By Fact 2.3.2, we know that j is an integer. Using this subsititution, we see that n^2 = 2(2k^2) = 2j. 
    Since j is an integer, we use definiton 2.1 to see that n^2 is even for all n. []








Problem 2.6: Prove that the statement "The sum of an even integer and an odd integer is odd.
  Proof: 
    Let n be an even integer and m be an odd integer. By definition 2.1 and 2.2 respectively, we can write n and m as 2k and 2j+1. Now, we write n+m as 2k+2j+1, which is equivalent to 2(k+j)+1. 
    We define a new variable i as i=(k+j). By substituting in i, we get 2(k+j)+1=2i+1. We know that i is an integer by Fact 2.3.2, and by Definiton 2.2 we know that n+m is odd. [] 








Question 2.7.1: Did Theorem 2.4 need to come before Problem 2.6?
  No.
Question 2.7.2: Could we have used Problem 2.6 to prove Theorem 2.4?
  Yes.
Question 2.7.3: Outline how this alternate proof would go.
  We could use Definitions 2.1 and 2.2 to prove that n and n+1 will never be both even or both odd, i.e. the question is a sum of an even number and an odd number by definition.
  Then we could use Problem 2.6 to prove that the sum of an even number and an odd number is odd.
  We use magic and alchemy to combine the two previous ingredients into a simple and beautiful proof that Theorem 2.4 is... Drumroll please... True! *applause break*
Question 2.7.4: Which way is better?
  I can see value in both ways. If the goal is simply to prove Theorem 2.4, I don't like using Problem 2.6 bacause it is faster and cleaner to prove the Theorem the way we did in the first place.
  However, Problem 2.6 is an interesting concept. Proving it leasds to much more interesting insights into the nature of integers and will be useful in thinking about integers moving forward.









Theorem 2.8: Provide a counterexample to the statement "The product of an even integer and and odd integer is odd."
  Conjecture 1: The product of an even integer and an odd integer is odd. 
  Proof:
    Lets consider the equation n*m=x, where n is an even integer and m is an odd integer. If Conjecture 1 is true, then x will be odd for any combination of n and m. 
    Lets test our conjecture with n=2 and m=3. In this case, n*m = 2*3 = 6 = x. 6 can be written in the form 2(3), or 2k where k=3. By Definiton 2.1, we see that 6 is even, therefore x is even. 
    This contradicts, and therefore disproves, Conjecture 1. []
