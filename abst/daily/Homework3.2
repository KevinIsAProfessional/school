Definition 2.1:
  An integer is even if n=2k for some integer k.
  
Definition 2.2:
  An integer is odd if n=2k+1 for some integer k.

Definiton 2.11:
  An integer n divides the integer m, written n|m, if and only if there exists an integer k such that m = nk. We may also say that m is divisible by n.

Fact 2.3.1:
  Every integer is either even or odd, but never both

Fact 2.3.2:
  Sums and products of integers are integers

Theorem 2.15:
  Assume n,m,a in Z. If a|n, then a|mn

Definition 3.3: Given two propositions A,B, we say that A is true if and only if B is true (A iff B, or A <==> B), if A is true exactly when B is true. That is, A <==> B means that if A is true then B is true, and if A is false then B is false.

Definition 3.4: Let A and B be propositions:
a) The proposition "not A" is true if and only if A is false; this is expressed symbolically as (i cant do this one here) -A and called the negation of A.
b) The proposition "A and B" is true if and onlyu if both A and B are true; this is expressed symbolically as (doing the best i can here) A^B, and is called the conjunction.
c) The proposition "A or B" is true if at least one of A or B is true; this is expressed symbolically as (forgive me) AvB and called the disjunction of A and B.
d) The proposition "If A, then B" is true if and only if whenever A is true, B is also true; this is expressed symbolically as (hey, i can actually do this one) A ==> B and is called an implication or conditional statement. Note that A ==> B may also be read "A implies B" or "A only if B".



######## Problems: #########
Problem 2.21: Assume a,b,m in Z. Determine whether or following statement holds sometimes, always, or never. "If ab divides m, then a divides m and b divides m." Justify with proof or counterexample
  


Exercise 3.2: Determine whether the following are propositions or not. Explain.
a) All cars are red
  This is a false proposition. There are things that exist, cars, that are a color. But the color is not always red.

b) Every person whose name begins with J has the name Joe.
  This is a false proposition. Jareds are real. Jareds aren't Joe. 

c) x^2 = 4
  This is not a proposition. In order for this sentence to be a proposition, we would have to have previously defined x. Then, if x were equal to 2, it would be true, otherwise it would be false.

d) There exists an x such that x^2 = 4.
  This is a true proposition. There is in fact a number (2) that could be equal to x, such that the sentence x^2 = 4 is true. 

e) For all real numbers x, x^2 = 4. 
  This is a false proposition. There is a real number x such that x^2 = 4, but for all other real numbers x^2 != 4. 

f) 2^(1/2) is an irrational number.
  This is a proposition, and I'm pretty sure it's true, although I'm fuzzy on the definition of irrational numbers.

g) p is prime. 
  This is not a proposition, because we do not know what value or concept p represents. We need to know the value of p before we can determine the truth or falsity of the sentence.

h) Led Zeppelin is the best band of all time. 
  This is not a proposition, because the truth of the statement is subjective. There is no way to categorically say that the sentence is true or false. 








Question 3.5: What’s the difference between “A=>B” and “A<=>B”?  Can you give an example of two statements A,B where A=>B is true but A<=>B is false? Can you give an example of two statements A,B where A<=>B is true but A=>B is false?
  A=>B means that if A is true then B is true, but if B is true, then A may or may not be true. It is a one way relationship.
  A<=>B means that if A is true then B is true, and if B is true then A is true. The same goes for false. They are they same in every instance.
  1a) If a shape is a square (A), then it is a rectangle (B). But if a shape is a rectangle (B), the shape may or may not be a square (A). A=>B is true, A<=>B is false.
  1b) 

  2) This is not a possible scenario. If A<==>B, then A==>B by definition.









Exercise 3.6: Describe the meaning of -(A^B) and -(AvB)
  Since A^B evaluates to true iff A is true and B is true, then -(A^B) is true either when A is false, when B is false, or when both A and B are false.
  Since AvB evaluates to true if A is true, B is true, or both A and B are true, -(AvB) evaluates to true iff A and B are both false. 









Exercise 3.7: Let A represent "6 is an even number" and B represent "6 is a multiple of 4". First, explain whu A and B are statements. Then, express each of the following statements in ordinary English sentences. Which of these statements are true? Why?
  
  a)
